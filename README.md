### What is Xclassifier?
Xclassifier is an efficient multi-label classifier
that trains an enhanced DenseNet-121 framework
with blur pooling to detect 14 observations from
a chest x-ray. It accomplishes an ideal memory utilization, GPU computation, and high AUC on two
large chest radiography datasets, MIMIC-CXR, and CheXpert.
